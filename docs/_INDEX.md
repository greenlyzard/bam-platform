# BAM Platform — Canonical Doc Index

> **READ THIS FIRST.** Before reading or writing any spec in `docs/`, consult
> this index to find the canonical doc for the topic. Subordinate docs are
> read only when explicitly referenced from canonical.
>
> Last reconciled: 2026-04-29 (topical map) · 2026-07-09 (spec-manifest + drift pass)
> See `docs/_AUDIT_2026_04_29.md` for the audit that produced the topical map, and the
> **Spec Manifest** + **Locations & Facilities** sections below (added 2026-07-09) for the
> per-spec mapping and the open drift list.

## How to use this index

- **Canonical** = the one authoritative file for a topic
- **Subordinate** = supporting specs that extend or detail the canonical
- **Deprecated** = drifted, superseded, or stale; flagged inline; do not implement
- **🟡 Pending** = canonical not yet decided; reconciliation scheduled

## Foundation
| Doc | Status |
|---|---|
| `/CLAUDE.md` | Canonical — session-start protocol |
| `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` | Canonical — schema source of truth |
| `docs/UI_STYLE_DIRECTIVES.md` | Canonical — portal styling (visual tokens) |
| `docs/_INDEX.md` | This file |
| `docs/_AUDIT_2026_04_29.md` | Reference — historical audit |

## Strategy & Modules
| Topic | Canonical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Module map (capabilities, M1–M13) | `docs/strategy/platform-product-requirements.md` | Canonical |
| Portal/route surface map | `docs/PORTAL_SURFACES.md` | Canonical |
| Sprint plan | `docs/ACTION_PLAN.md` | Living |
| Current state | `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` | Stale — refresh needed |
| Studio Pro comparison | `docs/STUDIO_PRO_COMPARISON.md` | + `docs/operations/studio-pro-gap-analysis.md` |
| Competitive analysis | `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` | + DANCEMASTERPRO, marketing/competitive-intelligence |

## Communications
| Topic | Canonical | Subordinate |
|---|---|---|
| All comms | `docs/COMMUNICATIONS.md` | HUB, INBOX, TRIAGE, PRIVATE_FEED, CONTACT_ALIASES, CONTACT_CHANNELS |
| Quick ref for Claude | `docs/claude/COMMUNICATIONS.md` | — |

## Scheduling
| Topic | Canonical | Vision/Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule + classes | `docs/CLASSES.md` + `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (current state) | `docs/SCHEDULING_AND_LMS.md` (design exploration) |
| Seasons & archival | `docs/SEASONS_AND_ARCHIVAL.md` | — |

**Deprecated:** `CALENDAR_AND_SCHEDULING.md`, `UNIFIED_SCHEDULE.md` (proposal rejected — see header)

## Locations & Facilities
| Topic | Canonical | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-location model (`studio_locations`, `rooms`, `location_hours`, `studio_closures`) | `docs/LOCATIONS_AND_FACILITIES.md` | ✅ Canonical (approved 2026-07-09) |
| Room / resource management | `docs/RESOURCE_INTELLIGENCE_SPEC.md` | Vision only — single-location, invents non-live tables |

🔴 **Known gap (flagged 2026-07-09).** The live DB has a multi-location model with **no governing
spec**: `studio_locations` (only `is_active` + `is_primary` — no published/visible flag), `rooms`
(`location_id`, `is_bookable`, `is_active`), `location_hours`, `studio_closures`, and
`classes.location_id`. Live admin CRUD exists in **two** duplicated places —
`app/(admin)/admin/settings/studio` and `app/(admin)/admin/resources/manage` — and rooms are
modelled **twice** (`rooms` **and** `studio_resources`, both carrying `location_id`).
`classes.location_id` is **display-only** (no staff editor sets it). The parent/public side has
**no location concept** (no label from `studio_locations`, no filter by `location_id`, no picker).
Live data: 2 locations — **San Clemente** (primary, 63 classes, 4 rooms) and **Rancho Santa
Margarita / "RSM"** (`is_active=true`, 0 classes, 3 rooms). Only *deprecated* docs
(`CLASSES_ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP.md`, `TENANT_PAYMENT_CONFIG.md`) even name these columns;
`strategy/platform-product-requirements.md` describes multi-location conceptually (M5) but names no
table and no route. ✅ **Resolved (2026-07-09):** canonical spec approved — see `docs/LOCATIONS_AND_FACILITIES.md`,
which supersedes this gap note with the reconciliation + build sequence. Pending task 11 tracks it.

## Pending Reconciliation Tasks
1. Enrollment master: pick REGISTRATION_AND_ONBOARDING vs ENROLLMENT_AND_PLACEMENT
2. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — Module count discrepancy. The two docs were not versions of the same list — they describe the platform from different angles. MODULES.md renamed to PORTAL_SURFACES.md (12 route surfaces); strategy PRD remains canonical for the M1–M13 capability taxonomy. New thin MODULES.md pointer file created to route readers to the right doc.
3. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — UNIFIED_SCHEDULE proposal rejected. /admin/schedule and /admin/classes intentionally remain separate surfaces serving distinct workflows. Class Builder enhancement tracked as item 10 below.
4. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — Teacher rate management. Doc rewritten to match live `teacher_rate_cards` schema. The earlier proposal of three split tables was replaced by a single consolidated rate-cards table in the live DB; doc now reflects that.
5. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — Teacher substitute system. Three docs rewritten: TEACHER_SUBSTITUTE_COVERAGE.md and TEACHER_ABSENCE_SUBSTITUTE_SUMMARY.md aligned to plural table names (absence_records, substitute_requests, substitute_alerts, substitute_authorizations, teacher_sub_eligibility) with workflow notes on the request-fill model. SUBSTITUTE_TEACHER.md (item #6) remains separately pending.
6. SUBSTITUTE_TEACHER (39KB): decide whether to build onboarding tables or rewrite doc
7. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — Style/UX nuance pass. Canonical UI_STYLE_DIRECTIVES.md created for portal app. Five docs reduced to three canonicals (BRAND.md for identity, UI_STYLE_DIRECTIVES.md for portal styling, UX_PATTERNS.md for component behaviors). website-theme-settings.md scoped to public WordPress site only. brand/brand-guidelines.md deprecated.
8. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — CLASSES_ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP rewrite no-longer-needed. Underlying conflicts resolved via D3 status constraint migration and CLASS_SCHEMA_DECISIONS.md. Doc stays deprecated as historical artifact.
9. ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — Inter-canonical class conflict resolution. See docs/CLASS_SCHEMA_DECISIONS.md. SCHEDULING_AND_LMS.md demoted to vision doc; CLASSES.md + DATABASE_SCHEMA.md are operational canonical.
10. Class Builder module — current /admin/classes is a basic CRUD surface. Spec needed for the real Class Builder workflow: bulk CSV import (see deferred docs/CLASS_CSV_IMPORT.md draft), drag-and-drop draft mode, multi-class conflict detection, capacity vs demand planning, atomic publish action that promotes drafts to active classes visible in /admin/schedule. Used during season planning, not day-to-day. Distinct from the operational /admin/schedule view.

### Added 2026-07-09 (spec-manifest + drift pass)
11. **Locations & Facilities — ✅ canonical spec approved 2026-07-09 · see `docs/LOCATIONS_AND_FACILITIES.md`.** The spec canonicalizes `studio_locations`/`rooms`/`location_hours`/`studio_closures`/`classes.location_id` (+ new `location_type` and `schedule_instances` override fields). Resolve the **duplicated admin CRUD** (`settings/studio` vs `resources/manage`) and the **double room model** (`rooms` vs `studio_resources`) into one. Decide whether the parent/public side gets a location label/filter/picker (today it has none) and whether a location needs a published/visible flag distinct from `is_active`. RSM now live as a 2nd location with 0 classes — before RSM classes publish, parents can't tell the two studios apart. See the Locations & Facilities section above.
    - **Verdict (rooms vs studio_resources, investigated 2026-07-09):** **`rooms` is canonical.** It is the FK target for `classes.room_id`, `schedule_instances.room_id`, and `schedule_templates.room_id` (all 63 live classes carry a `room_id`); it backs the class Room dropdown (`admin/classes/page.tsx:145` → `class-edit-drawer.tsx:830-838`, saving `classes.room_id`) and drives schedule, calendar, portal/widget feeds, **and** rentals + utilization (`lib/resources/utilization.ts`, `resources/rentals` read `rooms`, not `studio_resources`). It is written by exactly one CRUD, `settings/studio/actions.ts` ("Studio Profile"). **`studio_resources` is legacy/secondary:** its only live consumer beyond its own `resources/manage` CRUD is the per-class "Resources" multi-select, which writes `studio_resource_assignments` — **0 rows in prod**. Its 3 room-type rows are inactive duplicates of `rooms`; its `type`/`is_portable` equipment fields are read by nothing. Both CRUDs also write `studio_locations` (a genuine double-write, incl. two independent primary-flag-clear paths).
    - **Reconciliation plan (in order):**
      1. Strip the location CRUD (`createLocation`/`updateLocation`/`toggleLocationActive`) from `app/(admin)/admin/resources/manage/actions.ts` so `app/(admin)/admin/settings/studio/actions.ts` is the **sole `studio_locations` writer** — fixes the double primary-flag-clear bug.
      2. Remove the "Resources" multi-select in `app/(admin)/admin/classes/class-edit-drawer.tsx` (`:158-168`, `:527-539`) — it writes to the empty `studio_resource_assignments`.
      3. Keep the `studio_resources` table **dormant** (unused-but-harmless) for possible future equipment booking; retire only its CRUD (`resources/manage`) + the class-tag UI, not the table itself.
12. **RBAC specs — collapse three into one.** `RBAC_AND_PERMISSIONS.md` (canonical) vs deprecated `ROLE_BASED_NAV_SPEC.md`/`ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`. Even canonical shows FK `profile_roles.profile_id` while live is `user_id`; `SECURITY.md` RLS examples still use dropped `profiles.role`/`students.parent_id`/`classes.teacher_id`. Fix FK names + RLS examples to match live.
13. **Communications schema — reconcile the triple fork.** `COMMUNICATIONS.md` (`channels`) vs `COMMUNICATIONS_HUB.md` (`communication_groups`/`group_posts`) vs `COMMUNICATIONS_INBOX/TRIAGE` (`communication_threads`) — all three "authoritative/ready", all backed by live tables, none reconciled. Mark orphaned `COMMUNICATIONS_AND_STAFF_VISIBILITY.md` deprecated.
14. **Canonical schema doc is stale.** `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (declared canonical) last updated Mar 2026 — missing `contact_channels`, `curriculum_*`, `family_documents`, locations tables, etc. Regenerate from `types/database.types.ts`. Add deprecation header to parallel `DATA_MODEL.md` (uses dropped `user_role` enum).
15. **Naming drift sweep.** `user_profiles`→`profiles`, `sessions`/`class_sessions`→`schedule_instances`, `profile_id`→`user_id`, singular `timesheet_entry`/`pay_period`→plural. Recurs in ATTENDANCE, COMMUNICATIONS_INBOX, DATA_MODEL, NOTIFICATIONS, teacher timesheet docs.
16. **Unbuilt-schema (🧱) docs ride on ⚠NOT-IN-DB tables** — Billing (`invoices`/`billing_charges`), Contracts (4 tables), Ticketing (6 tables), Media Hub, Programs, Competition/Privates, Marketing Integrations, Integrations, Makeup. Decide build-vs-defer per area; add "schema not built" banners so they aren't implemented as-is.
17. **Route groups `(learn)` and `(shop)` are undocumented** in `PORTAL_SURFACES.md` (the canonical surface map). `(shop)/shop` is a placeholder (no `products`/`shop_orders` code). Either add them to the surface map or mark them not-yet-built.
18. **Stale build-status docs** contradict CLAUDE.md ✅-Live status (Angelina chatbot, M4 timesheets, RBAC described as "to-build"): `ACTION_PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md` (3/11), `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`, `PORTAL_FEATURES.md`, `operations/*`. Refresh or archive. Past-dated deadlines: PROGRAMS (Jun 6), Jackrabbit eval (Jun 2026), expansion (Q3 2026).
